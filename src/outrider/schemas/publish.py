# Cross-boundary publish carriers per docs/spec.md §4.1.7 + specs/2026-05-21-publish-node.md.
"""InlineComment + PublishResult + GitHubReviewCreated — publish-side carriers.

All three are frozen + extra="forbid" per the output-boundary trust rule
(`docs/trust-boundaries.md` §6): the model proposes, deterministic systems
dispose. The publisher constructs these from `ReviewFinding` + the
`coordinates.tree_sitter_to_github` location — no model field controls
publish routing or comment body content; sanitizer + coordinates own those.

`InlineComment.from_finding(...)` is the canonical production construction
path; the trust-boundary checklist (boundary #6) mandates this factory be
the only call site inside `src/outrider/`. Direct Pydantic construction
remains permitted for test fixtures that need to bypass the sanitizer
path, but an import-graph unit test forbids it inside `src/outrider/`.

`PublishResult` is the publish node's terminal state field — captured on
`ReviewState.publish_result` and rolled up into the dashboard's review-level
summary. Its three constructors (`success`, `empty`, `skipped`,
`skipped_external`) line up with the four non-`failed` `PublishAttemptOutcome`
variants; the publisher raises on `failed` outcomes rather than returning
a degraded result, matching the analyze convention of "failures propagate
and the start phase event is left dangling as the audit signal."
