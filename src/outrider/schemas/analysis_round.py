"""`AnalysisRound` per-pass results record.

Synthesize will consume the accumulated `list[AnalysisRound]` across all
analyze ⇄ trace iterations to build the final report. This module
defines the schema only; producers (the analyze node) and consumers
(synthesize) live in the sister analyze-implementation spec.

`round_id` is a SHA-256 hex digest used as the LangGraph reducer's merge
key (see `outrider.agent.reducers.append_with_dedup_by` in §2). The
hash is content-derived via `outrider.policy.canonical.compute_identity_hash`
so replay re-application is idempotent — same payload produces the same
id across processes, and duplicate rounds collapse on merge.
