"""Agent package — the 7-node LangGraph state machine.

V1 ships all seven canonical nodes: intake, triage, analyze, trace,
synthesize, hitl, and publish (per their respective node specs). The
graph factory lives in `agent/graph.py`; per-node bodies live in
`agent/nodes/`.

Module structure follows docs/conventions.md "File organization":
- `agent/state.py` — re-export shim of `outrider.schemas.review_state.ReviewState`
  so node files write `from outrider.agent.state import ReviewState` without
  reaching into `schemas/`.
- `agent/graph.py` — `build_graph(...)` factory exposing the V1
  seven-node graph (intake → triage → analyze ⇄ trace → synthesize →
  hitl → publish → END). All arguments are keyword-only; the canonical
  order is documented in `docs/spec.md §9.3`. See `build_graph`'s
  signature for the full required-dep set (LLM provider, eight
  audit-side sink Protocols + one anomaly sink, GitHub publisher,
  import-path resolver, etc.).
- `agent/nodes/<node>.py` — the per-node body.
- `agent/eval_driver.py` — `run_review(fixture_path)`, the eval graph driver
  the non-structural eval scenarios import (`from outrider.agent import
  run_review`). See `specs/2026-06-01-eval-graph-driver.md`.

# only re-entrancy during init, not external imports). Keeps the
